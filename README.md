# StacKit
Make more items stackable! Inspired by [Stackables](https://modrinth.com/mod/stackables).

This mod allows you to edit the maximum stack size of many non-stackable items. After running this mod once, go to your config directory and edit `stackit.toml` to configure the stack sizes of the items affected.
